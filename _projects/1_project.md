    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Founded and leading technical development of HoverNotes, a groundbreaking privacy-first AI video note-taking platform that eliminates context-switching in video-based learning. The platform features a sophisticated three-tier architecture (browser extension + web app + AI backend) enabling note-taking on any video platform while maintaining complete user privacy through local Obsidian vault storage.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Duration:</h3>
    <p>January 2025 â€“ Present (Founder & Technical Lead)</p>
    
    <h3>Key Technical Achievements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal Video Integration:</strong> Built advanced video detection system working across all platforms (YouTube, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, Bilibili, etc.) using DOM mutation observers and cross-origin message passing</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-First Architecture:</strong> Implemented local-first storage with direct Obsidian vault integration using Chrome's File System Access API - zero cloud data collection</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Extension Mastery:</strong> Chrome Manifest V3 implementation with advanced permission management, service workers, and floating iframe-based editor</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Enhanced Learning:</strong> Integrated multi-modal processing with real-time streaming note generation and LangGraph reasoning agents</li>
        <li><strong>Global Scale Engineering:</strong> 45+ language localization with AI note generation adapted to linguistic nuances and cultural learning styles</li>
        <li><strong>Screenshot Integration:</strong> Automated video frame capture with precise timestamp correlation and organized storage</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Technical Stack:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Lexical Editor (Meta's rich text framework)</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Extension:</strong> Manifest V3, File System Access API, tabCapture API, Cross-origin messaging</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python FastAPI, LangGraph, Docker, PostgreSQL</li>
        <li><strong>AI/ML:</strong> Custom reasoning agents, Multi-modal video processing, Real-time transcription</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Hetzner Cloud, Docker Compose, Nginx, SSL/TLS automation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Business Impact:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Addressing the $68B online education market with privacy-first solution as data protection becomes critical</li>
        <li>First platform combining universal video compatibility + AI enhancement + complete privacy</li>
        <li>Eliminated context-switching between video watching and note-taking applications</li>
        <li>Empowering learners with complete control over their educational data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Innovation Highlights:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Innovation:</strong> Single extension working universally across all video platforms without platform-specific code</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Leadership:</strong> Local-first architecture in era of cloud-dependent note-taking solutions</li>
        <li><strong>AI Enhancement:</strong> Multi-modal processing beyond simple transcription available in existing tools</li>
        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Seamless note-taking overlay that never interrupts video learning flow</li>
    </ul>
